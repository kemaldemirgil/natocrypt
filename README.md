> NATO phonetic alphabet password-hashing module

Natocrypt was created to convert your text into a NATO phonetic alphabet hash with a little more encryption. It does not provide a fully secure encryption, it was made for simplicity and basic usage. \
It basically uses each letter representation with a reversed format. Some characters and capital letters are not yet supported.

This package is open to contributions.


## Installation:
```console
npm install natocrypt
```
## Usage:
There are only 2 methods available.
```js
encrypt() & decrypt()
```

```javaScript
const Natocrypt = require("natocrypt")
```
Init Natocrypt
```javaScript
const nato = new Natocrypt();
```
Encrypt a text
```javaScript
nato.encrypt("very secret text")
> tangoxrayechotango$tangoechoromeocharlieechosierra$yankeeromeoechoviktor
```
Decrypt a text
```javaScript
nato.decrypt("tangoxrayechotango$tangoechoromeocharlieechosierra$yankeeromeoechoviktor")
> very secret text
```
